# ML Models

Directory for machine learning models related to autism research and detection.

## Structure

```
ml/
├── models/          # Trained model files (.pkl, .h5, .onnx, etc.)
├── notebooks/       # Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
├── training/        # Training scripts
├── preprocessing/   # Data preprocessing utilities
└── evaluation/      # Model evaluation scripts
```

## Usage

This directory is intended to store:
- Trained model artifacts
- Model training scripts
- Data preprocessing pipelines
- Evaluation metrics and reports
- Experiment notebooks

## Model Guidelines

- Always document model versions and training parameters
- Include model cards with performance metrics
- Store model metadata (training date, dataset version, etc.)
- Follow ethical AI practices (see main README)
